Features:
	* Akismet (https://akismet.com/signup/#free) and Mollom (http://mollom.com/) external SPAM filter services.
	* Internal keyword based filter of any type of content.
	* Group Topic Reply and Blog post check against all the three services.

There are some known issues when using Mollom. When the server responds with 'unsure' the content is categorized based on the quality score. Look at /lib/spam_moderation.php for more details how it is implemented.
